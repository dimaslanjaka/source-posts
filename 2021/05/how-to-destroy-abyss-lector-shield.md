    To effectively defeat the boss and eliminate their safeguard/shield, accumulate them at the tip of the field and consistently harm them.
    
2.  **Thundering Fury On Bennett**

    You can use Bennett and spam his Skill to rapidly demolish the shields of the Abyss Lector. 4 set Thundering Fury will shorten the already short Cooldown of Bennett's skill enabling him to constantly deal Overload against the shielded Abyss Lector.
