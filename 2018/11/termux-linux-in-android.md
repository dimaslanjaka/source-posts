==========================================================================================================================================================================================================

You are a _Linux_ lover, like to play with the_Linux operating system_ , accustomed to using the_Linux_ _console_ . You are also an Android user, like _Android_ . iyup _termux_ is a _linux emulator_ .said linux emulator because here we can _install_ console-based Linux applications that are like other Linux applications, such as_MariaDB Server_ , _Apache Server, FTP Server_ , _Samba Server and_ even _SSH Server_ .

[![I can do Linux commands directly on my cellphone.](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ghyitbyrvquXK8iDjVjzYeuTlL8EJV0JAzrJzpnIIlX0XApl0FmVkI9YsfafrrMnOXdnTZKrbX3xkMzUhBg=w1080-h1920-rw-no)](#ghyitbyrvquXK8iDjVjzYeuTlL8EJV0JAzrJzpnIIlX0XApl0FmVkI9YsfafrrMnOXdnTZKrbX3xkMzUhBg=w1080-h1920-rw-no)

I can do Linux commands directly on my cellphone.

_termux_is an application and also an emulator, we can _maintain the android_ we have, do the _sudo_ command (need root) or even become our cellphone as a _mini server_ for various purposes. for those who like to use Linux times to test network security, this application is suitable for you, we can install various _security_ applications that run on the _console_ .for example I can run htop in termux and the following results.

[![HTOP in termux](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bfoTXU6_-fNYxQPM5euwmy9ca3N5-R_OxE6HDEy0PTYJ-Awqn1XTNKymm3A2izIEvhwtauqM-k6rwW0hIaU=w1080-h1920-rw-no)](#https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bfoTXU6_-fNYxQPM5euwmy9ca3N5-R_OxE6HDEy0PTYJ-Awqn1XTNKymm3A2izIEvhwtauqM-k6rwW0hIaU=w1080-h1920-rw-no)

HTOP in termux

the point is _termux_ is a complete linux _operating system_ that has been ported in such a way as to run on android. the difference with Linux installers on other [Androids](#) (as in my writing [Install Ubuntu on an Android phone](/search/?q=install+ubuntu) ), if the _Linux installer_ on other [Androids](#stall-ubuntu-di-hp-android/) on average use the OS itself which will cause very heavy and must be booted every time you want to run, termux uses direct _operating_ _Linux__system_ that is the basis of Android. so what we change using _Termux_ will also change Android (because _Android_ is actually a Linux application that runs on top of the _Dalvik Virtual Machine,_ while Thermux, for the UX problem he joins _Android_ , but the core system goes directly to the _Android Linux_ system).

MariaDB running server directly from HP. next time I will share how to setup it.

as I said before, we can install various Linux applications in termux, for example I _installed Maria DB_ and run it, besides that I also installed _Apache_ server so I could use the web, and as a result I have _a portable server_ on my cellphone. then what's the question for? if by chance you are an IT practitioner working here and there, here and there, applications like this are quite helpful in emergencies. maybe next time I will post about how to install it, so I'll see you in another post, Okey _Donkey_ and welcome to Website Development Indonesia
