What is [an expired domain](https://www.webmanajemen.com/search/?q=expired+domain) ?  

Expired domain is a domain whose active period is not renewed by the previous owner so we can re-register.  
Then, why should we look for expired domains?  
Is not the new domain better because we can choose a domain name according to our wishes?  
Well, buying a new domain is something common and much done by internet marketers, whether it's for personal websites, companies or moneysite (the main web for earning). But in some cases (especially for internet marketers who are involved in SEO), buying an expired domain can be an option that has its own advantages compared to buying a new domain.  
What are the benefits? The main thing is to bypass the authority that is generally owned by expired domains, which of course is not owned by a new domain. So later, the website can be easier and faster ranking on search engines.  

3 Main Functions of Expired Domain:
-----------------------------------

### \- As Moneysite

With the authority it has, the expired domain can be a potential moneysite.  

### \- As a PBN

Expired domain can also be made a strong [PBN](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://www.rohadiright.com/pbn-untuk-link-building-seo%26usg%3DALkJrhhpb1n12ztzd_anaE97iunEaUXFBA&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_R1k_fHxfVc5LIzKjgwk1ymGKmTug) (Private Blog Network) to boost the ranking of web-web moneysite on search engines.  

### \- As 301 Redirects

Finally, an expired domain can be used to bypass linkjuice to a new domain with a 301 redirect technique (not recommended for beginners, use at your own risk).  

Domain Stages After Expired
---------------------------

Before going any further, there are some things you should know about expired domains.  
Once the domain becomes expired, there are several steps that must be passed. For each registrar (Godaddy, Namecheap, Dynadot, etc.) this stage may vary in time.  
Here are the stages of the domain from the first expired until the domain is auctioned or deleted from the registrar. In this stage I use [Godaddy](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://www.godaddy.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhjPdhL9Hq_ADr-a7ydWz9Z_qcXyEA&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_Q9FxJuKgFWayX9gwf6EXJMt0CNzQ) as a reference, for other registrar could be different period of time.  

Days after domain expired

Information

Day 1

Domains are in Grace Period status. Godaddy tries to bill and renew automatically (if the domain owner is set to auto-renew) to extend the domain's active life

Day 5

Godaddy tried to do the bills and renew automatically for the second time. If it still fails, the domain will be directly inserted into domain parking. At this stage, the domain owner can still extend the domain without being charged a fine

Day 12

Godaddy tries to do automatic renew for the third or last time.At this stage, the domain owner can still extend the domain without being charged a fine

Day 19

Domains can be renewed domain owners with a $ 80.00 fine fee

Day 26

Domain entered into the auction at Godaddy (https://auctions.godaddy.com) with BID system

Day 36

Domain auction expires. If the domain is still unsold, the domain will be put into a closeout auction (closeout auction). In closeout auction this applies BIN system (Buy it Now)

Day 41

Closeout auction ends

Day 42

Last chance for the old owner to renew the domain. If the old owner renews the domain at this stage, the cost of the auction winner / closeout will be refunded

Day 43

Domain submitted to the winner of the auction / closeout. If until this stage the domain is not also sold (no one doing BID or BIN) then the domain will be submitted to the registry

Day 44

Domain back to registry and in Redemption Period status for 30 days. In this stage the domain can only be extended by the old owner, of course with the cost of a fine

Day 74

Domain in Pending Delete status for 5 days. In this stage the domain can no longer be extended by the old owner

Day 79

Domain status is Deleted. The domain is re-released to the public and can be purchased like a new domain. Age domain is also set back to 0

Aged Domains vs. Dropped Domains
--------------------------------

You may often hear the term _aged domain_ and _dropped domains_ , especially if you are interested in the linkbuilding method via PBN.  
Then what is the difference between aged domain and dropped domain? Which is better between the two types of expired domains?  
Aged domains and dropped domains have their respective deficiencies and advantages. But to help you differentiate and choose which one is more suitable for you, let me give you a little explanation of the difference.  
From the table above, aged domain is if you buy expired domain with auction system between day 26th to day 41. Why ? Because you renew (extend the active period) domain before the domain is returned to the registry.  
While the expired domain dropped domain category if you do renew (more precisely buy) domain after day-79. Why ?Because you bought after the domain is returned to the registry and the domain age is set back to 0.  
**Advantages of aged domains:**  
\- Can be distinguished between deindex domains with those still indexed  
\- Domain age is not reset to 0  
**Lack of aged domains:**  
\- The price is more expensive because it pays the cost of domain + renew  
\- Less flexible in choosing a domain name, because it adjusts to the stock in the auction / auction.  
**Advantages of dropped domains:**  
\- The price is cheaper because it is just like buying a new domain  
\- More flexible in choosing a domain name due to abundant stock  
**Disadvantages of dropped domains:**  
\- It is hard to distinguish between deindex or not, because almost all dropped domain indexnya return 0  
\- Age domain reset to 0  
Aged domains and dropped domains have their own shortcomings and advantages, if you want to find expired domains either for Moneysite or PBN, just adjust it with budget and requirement.  

Websites that provide list / list of expired domains
----------------------------------------------------

After knowing the function and the difference of expired domain, you also want to know where to get the list of expired domains.Here is the list:

*   etc

Good expired domain criteria:
-----------------------------

In addition, what you should know before looking for an expired domain is to analyze the metrics of those domains whether it is feasible to be Moneysite / PBN or not.  
Keep in mind, the following metrics or criteria are **only a guide, not references that must be accepted and applied in absolute terms** . In fact, every SEO practitioner can vary in determining the boundaries that exist. Moreover, the majority of these metrics are not officially made by Google or other search engines, so there is no guarantee that the results are 100% appropriate or close to the existing algorithm.  

### DA / PA

DA (Domain Authority) and PA (Page Authority) are metrics developed by [Moz](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://moz.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhjcvuhRGjBazxfsj9j2BR2iO8B7yg&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_RSFQTkKpSvBvPLmlSLPxzQhWyR3w) .  
The DA & PA value of a domain varies from 0 s / d 100. The higher the DA / PA domain, the higher the domain authority (according to Moz). This is not entirely wrong, but it is also not entirely true.  
DA / PA is strongly influenced by incoming links to a domain, regardless of the [quality of](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://www.rohadiright.com/backlink-berkualitas%26usg%3DALkJrhiQ_2OxwCO4aGpL8cFvqpwaEAS7cw&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_QE8OjOzWiOz3x4lunX71qImezFsw) those [links](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://www.rohadiright.com/backlink-berkualitas%26usg%3DALkJrhiQ_2OxwCO4aGpL8cFvqpwaEAS7cw&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_QE8OjOzWiOz3x4lunX71qImezFsw) . This makes it easy to manipulate.  

[![Example DA PA](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://i.imgur.com/y4covPv.jpg "Example DA PA")](http://i.imgur.com/y4covPv.jpg)

Example DA PA

Each SEO practitioner can vary in determining DA / PA at least an expired domain that is eligible for purchase. There are at least 10, 15, 20 even have a minimum of over 30.  
Tools for DA / PA check:

*   etc

### TF / CF

TF (Trust flow) and CF (Citation Flow) are the metrics developed by [Majestic](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://majestic.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhhIj8l5RMATictsamN2ZbP0_hA-aw&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_T-ZDAmJNfsoyUyps6PLSS6CYRu2A) .  
Unlike DA / PA, TF / CF focuses not only on backlinks coming into a domain, but also the quality of the backlink.  
The value of the TF (Trust flow) of a domain is influenced by the authority of the websites that provide backlinks, while the value of CF (Citation Flow) is influenced by the number of mentions received by a domain on the internet (regardless of the backlink or not leading to the domain.  
The value of TF / CF also varies from the lowest (0) to the highest (100).  
Ideally, the higher the TF value the greater the quality of the domain.  

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://i.imgur.com/NYVXeN1.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/NYVXeN1.jpg)

this blog has a flawed Trust Flow value ...> \_ <

But not with CF. Overly high CFs often indicate that the domain is used for spamming, especially if it is not matched by a balanced TF value.  
Ideally, the CF value is not more than 2x its TF value.  
If the value of TF 22 for example, the good CF value is 44 down.  
To check the TF / CF of a domain, you can go directly to the website [https://majestic.com/](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://majestic.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhhIj8l5RMATictsamN2ZbP0_hA-aw&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_T-ZDAmJNfsoyUyps6PLSS6CYRu2A)  

### Index

If you select aged domain then the domain must still be indexed in Google.  
You can check on Google by typing "site: namadomain.com" (without the quotes)

How to Check Index of expired domains

For the type of dropped domain is not required index checking, because 99% of its index has been deleted by Google.  

### Domain Age

For aged domain types the average SEO practitioner suggests a domain age of at least 2 years.  
To check the age domain you can use whois checker such as:  

*   [whois.com](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://www.whois.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhhMUJHSQYcmUoYJw1fYpIDU9oiMXg&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_Qg3tSVy4pqBtA9mXqngpvBBqc2KQ)
*   [whois.net](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://whois.net/%26usg%3DALkJrhhPtRAJythQ23khBr0sHJxAT_6T6w&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_RT1UXzVT6ANru7RY_LyB-bzigfNQ)

*   etc

Domain age is calculated from the first domain registered (Registration Date) to the current time.

How to check domain age

For this type of dropped domain you do not need to use the domain age benchmark.  

### Drop no more than 2x

It is also widely suggested by SEO practitioners.  
I personally do not consider this point too important. You can improvise and do your own trial error to find the minimum / maximum number of drop times that you think fit.  
To see how many times a domain has dropped you can check in [whois.domaintools.com](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://whois.domaintools.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhjOnwMCiIxkXk6D1KL0zjzA4ZO8Cg&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_TnUGhBCTcI8x7WwXusgeO8-jDhkA) :

How to check dropped domains

### Backlink

This is one of the most crucial points in determining whether or not an expired domain is good.  
Backlinks play a major role in determining the performance of an expired domain in the future, whether it is for moneysite or PBN.  
Some things you should look for in checking backlinks:  

*   **Comparison between referring domains with a reasonable total backlink**

If a domain has a total of 153 backlinks and the backlinks come from 40 domains, this is a reasonable number. But if the domain has a total of 1500's backlinks and comes only from 30s domain, this becomes a big question mark.  
Total backlinks with lots of referring domains that are too few usually indicate that many backlinks installed sitewide, whether it's in the sidebar or footer. And as is well known, sitewide backlinks in the sidebar / footer are not very good for websites, especially if the niche / topic is irrelevant.  
Ideally, the total number of backlinks is not more than 10x the number of referring domains.  
For example, the number of referring domain 13, then the total maximum number of backlinks not more than 130.  
If the number of referring domains 50, then the total number of backlinks total no more than 500. And so on ...  
[![Backlink domains vs referring domains](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://i.imgur.com/5vLrNpO.jpg "Backlink domains vs referring domains")](http://i.imgur.com/5vLrNpO.jpg)  
Does that mean total backlinks with lots of referring domains that are too few definitely spam and should we avoid ??  
Not necessarily.  
Again this is just a guide that you do not have to apply exactly.  
If you find a domain with a lot of backlinks and referring lots of domains too little, you must perform a step backlink check next is...  

*   **Check backlink one by one**

A good or bad backlink is not determined by its quantity, but its quality. For that you have to check one by one to determine the quality of the backlink.  
Is not tiring to check backlinks one by one ??  
What if there are hundreds of backlinks, or thousands ??  
Well, you can use the features of backlink checkers like [Ahrefs](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://www.rohadiright.com/ahrefs-tutorial-backlink-kompetitor%26usg%3DALkJrhh_tvqc1vyvlfVNuBc4gsQdeE5PGg&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_R3mz0rFuPFcEWi0AOBNV6P4e-lEw) to display only 1 link per domain.  
For example, a domain has a backlink as much as 800. But the 800's backlinks are from 83 referring domains.  
With Ahrefs, you can display only 83 backlinks taken from 83 referring domains. So every referring domain is displayed only 1 sample backlink it only.  

[![One link per domain on ahrefs](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://i.imgur.com/riQhGF4.jpg "One link per domain on ahrefs")](http://i.imgur.com/riQhGF4.jpg)

One link per domain on ahrefs

*   **Authority Backlink vs Clean Backlink**

Many suggest that to get a quality exired domain you should look for domains that get backlinks from authority sites like Huffington Post, Wikipedia, Masable, Engadget, educational web (.edu) web or government web (.gov).  
This suggestion is true, although in my opinion it is not 100% true.  
If the expired domain you are analyzing gets a backlink from the Authority web-site as above then it is a plus point, but if it does not need to be discouraged.  
Expired domain is not required to have a backlink authority to be made Moneysite / PBN potential, the most important in my opinion is clean backlink backlinks alias free from spam.  

*   **Contextual Links**

Expired domain is good in my opinion is the majority of backlinks form contextual links or are in the article.  
The reason? The backlinks in the big articles are likely to be relevant to the content of the article, making it less likely to be spam.  

*   **Anchor text**

Anchor text is equally important.  
The expired domain with backlinks from the web authority will be useless if its anchor text like this:  
![example anchor text spam](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://i.imgur.com/TGxrlvd.jpg "Example anchor text spam")  

[![Spam 2 example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/spammy-anchor-text-2.jpg "Anchor text spam 2")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/spammy-anchor-text-2.jpg)

Along with the more often you analyze and look for a good expired domain, you will be more accustomed and can distinguish between spammy and legit anchor text just by seeing it at a glance.  
A good anchor text is a lot of names or brand domains.  
Conversely, domains with the anchor text of the majority of "buying keywords" such as: cheap, sell, online, buy, affordable and so forth is usually the domain of spam. You must be careful and meticulous in buying expired domains of this type.  

### History domain

History domain is also very important to check, because it can show how the domain look in the past. Has the domain ever been used for spam websites, gambli \* g, p \* rno, redirect, websites with foreign languages ​​and so forth.  
Two popular free tools that I often use to check the history of expired domains are:  

*   [Wayback Machine](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://archive.org/web/%26usg%3DALkJrhhs37AzujkO3RS4t75vgmPxttFgWA&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_R8UCcVS1pJPBKF-j6VIqSeDwtwHA)
*   [Screenshot History](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://research.domaintools.com/research/screenshot-history/%26usg%3DALkJrhggUeI3m982F-5fr_yqG48ZSVLBpg&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_S_qrgO3mVCgMyEuEsDJ2_iHEfa1A)

For domain history, we recommend avoiding the former domains of PBN, gambli \* g, p \* rno, dr \* gs and other sensitive or illegal niches.  

### Niche

If used for PBN, it would be better if the niche / topic domain tailored to its moneysite. But this is also not mandatory. If other criteria are eligible and the backlinks are okay, I usually keep buying the expired domain even though its niche is somewhat deviated from my moneysite.  
For the niche domain is tailored to the needs. Sometimes there is a niche moneysite is quite unique so it is difficult to find expired domain with a similar niche, there is also a niche its quite common as travel or health that expired its domain is relatively easier to find.  
To check the domain niche you can use Wayback Machine & History Domain or use Topical Trust Flow metrics in Majestic.com.  

### Domain name

If used as a PBN, the domain name in my opinion does not really matter. Short and memorable domain names are even better than KOD (keyword on domain).  
Conversely for Moneysite, domain with partial match (incoming keyword inthe domain name) I think is one of the best, such as: Buzz**Tattoes.com** , John **Design.com** , Nina **Weddings.com**and so on.  

### Extensions

The domain extension is actually free here, but if it could be better .com, be it for moneysite and PBN. The other alternative is .net and .org  
3 Extensions above is the longest domain extension (other than .info and .biz) are circulating on the internet so the matter of credibility in the eyes of the visitor is no longer questionable. Unlike new extensions like .xyz, .co, .club or maybe .rocks.  

Criteria / metrics I do not use to search for expired domains:
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Pagerank

Pagerank has not updated for a long time and indeed according to official info it will not update again.  
So this metric is no longer relevant to be used as a benchmark in finding expired domains.  

### Spam Score

[Spam Score](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://moz.com/blog/spam-score-mozs-new-metric-to-measure-penalization-risk%26usg%3DALkJrhgF6CGEoUj5D1JaoX_wKuhkb_PeYg&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_TXAdp9DzdV_rDLcwTbjzDN4bWi1g) is a metric developed by Moz. This metric serves to assess the level of spam a website.  
Minimum Spam Score value is 0/17 and maximum 17/17. The higher the spam score score the higher the possibility of the website is used for spam.  
From the questions that go into my fb and the discussions in the local forum that I follow, it seems some SEO players still use this metric in determining the quality of expired domains.  
Some tutorials how to search for expired domains that I found on Google also suggest spam score should be spanned certain values.  
I myself do not use spam score metrics because I do not fit some of the elements [on page](http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://www.rohadiright.com/seo-on-page%26usg%3DALkJrhh38ELCoE4gWOr7wf3I-hqr1_sYmw&ts=1518276508&sig=AOyes_R2fhegcf53alhwxGzgHa8sklQxaQ) are used as benchmarks such as: the presence or absence of contact info, the number of external links, the number in the domain name and so forth.  

[![Example score of spam](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/spam-score.jpg "Example spam score")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/spam-score.jpg)

  
If you want to use Spam Score metrics, make sure you do not follow the results given 100%.Manually checking the domain history is required.  

How to Find Expired Domains at ExpiredDomains.net
-------------------------------------------------

Lastly, it's incomplete to read tutorials on how to search for expired domains without putting them into practice.  
In this guide, I use expireddomains.net because this service is free, so you can practice right away without having to pay for subscription.  
To be able to use the features in expireddomains.net to the fullest, you must register first.  
After Register & Login, you will see the menus as below:  

[![Setting menu in ExpiredDomains.net](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/menu-expireddomains.jpg "Setting menu in ExpiredDomains.net")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/menu-expireddomains.jpg)

  
To search for an aged domain type, click the**Marketplace Domain** Menu (number 1) and then select **GD Expired** (No. 2).  
_GD Expired_ is the auction place for newly expired domains (day 26 s / d 35 in the expired domain stages table above).  
Or you can choose **GD Closeouts**(no 3) if you want to find a domain that can be purchased immediately (BIN).  
_GD Closeouts_ is the auction place after the domain does not sell at auction in GD Expired (36th day s / d 41 in the expired domain step table above).  
As for searching for the type of dropped domain, click Menu **Deleted Domains** (number 4) then select the domain extension you want.  

[![Set 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/menu-dropped-domain.jpg "Setting 2")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/menu-dropped-domain.jpg)

  
After choosing between aged domain / dropped domain, then is to do the filter for the emerging domains will be in accordance with the criteria we want.  
To filter, click ' _Show Filter_ ':  

[![Show filter](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/show-filter.jpg "Show filter")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/show-filter.jpg)

  
There are 4 main menus in this filter:**Common, Additional, Adwords & SEO** and **Majestic** .  
Not all menus / filters should be filled in. Just adjust it to your needs.  
If you are looking for an expired domain for PBN for example, then the Adwords filter is almost useless to fill.  
For more details, let's learn the menus one by one.  

### The "Common" Menu Tab

[![Common menu tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tab-menu-common.jpg "Common menu tab")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tab-menu-common.jpg)

  

*   **Domain Name Whitelist**

This filter is used to search for domains based on certain keywords / words.  
Unless you want to search for KOD type domains, I recommend clearing this option.  

*   **Domain Name Blacklist**

Opposite degan filter above, this filter is used to not display domains that have keyword / certain word.  

*   **Domain Name Contains ... AND**

Almost the same function as "Domain Name Whitelist", but here you can enter 2 keywords / words or more and placement does not have to be exact.  
Suppose you enter the keyword "expired domain" (without quotation marks) then this filter will display domains that have keyword / word "expired" and "domain" such as: expired123domain.com, domain07expired.com, and so forth.  

*   **Domain Name (un) wanted Chars**

Almost the same function with "Domain Name Blacklist" but this filter is used only for 1 character (1,2,3, A, B, C and so on).  

*   **Domain Name Pattern**

This filter is used to search for domains whose names have a pattern / pattern.  
Example: domain prefix using consonant (BCDFGH dead letter), second character domain using vowel (vowel AIUEO), last character domain using numbers and so on.  
Unless you want to find a domain with a very good and brandable name (which is likely to cost too much) it should be empty of this option.  

*   **Domain Name Settings**

_no Numbers_ : check if you do not want to display domains that have numbers.

*   **Original gTLDs**

This filter is used to display domains with certain extensions.  
_only gTLDs_ : check if you only want to display domains included in gTLDs (Generic Top-Level Domains) such as .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info and so on.

For other filters in this Tab Menu like _Geo Domains, Name in selected TLD is available, Name in selected TLD is registered, Related Domains CNOBI, Related Domains CNO, Related Domains .COM_ and _Social Namecheck_ I will not explain because this filter in my opinion is not too important in finding expired domains.  

### "Adwords & SEO" Tab menu

[![Menu tab adwords and seo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tab-menu-adwords-seo.jpg "Adwords And Seo menu tab")](http://www.rohadiright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tab-menu-adwords-seo.jpg)

Conclusion
----------

To find a qualified expired domain requires comprehensive analysis and detailed start of domain quality, backlinks, history and so on.  
There is no definite minimum / maximum limit of any existing metrics, so please improvise on your own to find the right composition and the results to your liking.  
The more you often hunting expired domains, the more resilient your sharpness in finding and finding a quality expired domain, either as PBN or moneysite.
