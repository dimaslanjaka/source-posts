*   Go to your browser settings menu select **Settings**
*   Show advanced settings
*   In the privacy section select **Content settings**

  
If the AdSense application process returns to the start each time you try to submit it, you may have to change your browser settings by checking the settings of the browser you are using, if you use the **Chrome** browser enable cookies and SSL 2.0 and clear the browser cache.

After doing so, try submitting your application again. Delivery is now successful. Admin experience is only up to the settings of this browser **send** button works properly and delivery is successful, but if you still fail and still go back to the beginning when you use the last (alternative).   
  
1- Get out of all google accounts, then delete all data and passwords stored in the browser then reset the browser.
