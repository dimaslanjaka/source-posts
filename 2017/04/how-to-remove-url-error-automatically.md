so to see it this way because this way berdsarkan my own experience and has been tested at the ITB and IPB. huh :) but you do not need to be too serious because of how extremely easy.

*   Lets you copy the tag below

> <b: if cond = 'data: blog.pageType == & quot; error\_page & quot;'> <meta content = "noindex, nofollow 'name =' robots '/> <meta content =" noindex, nofollow' name = 'Googlebot' /> </ b: if>

*   then Paste under the <head>
*   Save Template

  

Furthermore, you have to do is wait a day and check back url error. if there is a rest please delete itself because it only removes the tag urls indexed Blum error. so if there are remaining error that means the url that is already indexed.
