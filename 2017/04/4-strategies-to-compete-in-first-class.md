This means that if targeting these keywords then you have to compete with other articles 6,200,000.  
One way that you can rely on to compete with these keywords is presenting the article title using [long tail keywords](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=id&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://strukturkode.blogspot.co.id/2014/10/apa-itu-longtail-keywords.html&usg=ALkJrhjA5ENXSh4RQmgmzNnqC7y6tBRvIQ) , title long tail keywords will be able to make your article likely to appear with a variety of relevant keywords so that your articles will have many opportunities to be found in search results and can increase traffic to your blog.
