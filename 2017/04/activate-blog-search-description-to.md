Blog search description activate important to improve CTR, SEO and relevance of articles
========================================================================================

  
You probably already know the character of the search engines, especially Google, you can see and analyze how the Google search engine displays the title of your blog on search engine results page (SERP) when it managed to appear in the best position, observe, you will definitely see the title of the blog and a brief description below, yes almost all search engines, especially google, when displaying search results that are displayed normally blog title and a brief description at the bottom.  
  
A short description that appears at the bottom could be a description of the searches that you do, if the description is relevant to the keyword search engine, if not then the description that appears is the result of processing a search engine by combining the words that are relevant are selected from the contents of the article.  
  
A short description that appears at the bottom of the title in the search results is actually to provide brief information to the search engine users, and descriptions that appear to determine the number of clicks on the title of your article in the search results, if the title or description they consider relevant or representative of what is being they are looking for, then you can bet they will decide to visit your blog, thus indirectly Descriptions can increase CTR (Click throught rate) of the article.

Meta description of the search description does not constitute _200+ google ranking factors_ , but the presence of meta description on every page of the blog post article can determine the degree of relevance of the article to the keywords used by Internet users, so even though Google does not enter into the search description one of the factors seo , but its existence is worth considering because it does not directly contribute to determine the quality seo articles concerned.  
  
I personally still search description required to be included, because I think the incredible benefits to improve the relevance of the article, increasing the key vocabulary and also increase the CTR (Click Trought Rate clicked the title of the article) when he was found in the search results.
