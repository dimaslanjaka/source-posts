Tips on Optimizing Google Adsense With A / B Testing
----------------------------------------------------

Website general news world-class giant Daily Mail level often use A / B testing to find this tertinggi.Kali my ad performance will only review course, does not provide trick on how to perform A / B testing, because it had no instructions at our adsense account respectively.  

(I) Optimizing adsense were divided into two, namely optimization blog and adsense ad optimization.

1\. Optimization blog optimization is carried out only in the blog itself, which includes SEO, web design / template, robots.txt, niche article, placement / ad layout located, and what can be done on the blog itself. The goal is to bring traffic blog, capture the targeted visitor, targeting niche market, etc.

2\. While the adsense ad optimization is an optimization that could only be done in your adsense account and not to do in the blog. That includes reformatting the ad, made custom channels, url channels, and other experiments by utilizing what features are available in your adsense account. The goal is to maximize the performance of your ads to earn as high as possible.

Now the question is;

(?) Did you understand all optimization features in your own adsense account?Not all publishers understand their own adsense account.

(?) Have you ever tested your ad performance using Experiments A & B?Not all publishers do, but it is important for the fate of your income.

A / B experiment is a tool for testing the performance of an ad unit with a different format. The goal is to compare the format which performs better for revenue? That the purposes of A and B.

Without A / B testing, the ad format that you create your own and place it on your blog today is not necessarily generate maximum revenue, is not necessarily suited to the circumstances in your blog.

If you want to know which format is the maximum, then we must ask google through A / B experiment. Because google more out which ad is actually the most high-income your blog based segmentation of the ads they noted.

(I) Well, this time we can use the Experiments AB beta. There we can test one ad which resulted in two colors.What colors are the most clicked on by the user, which is the best color to be selected. You can test multiple ad units at once.

This test can be run up to a month to your ad units reached the number "belief" up to 95%, and long- or short testing time dependent traffic to your blog. After the figures indicate 95% confidence, please select the ad formats "superior" is. Ads that win was secured good at making money.

Thus adsense ads are now posted on your blog is the most effective adsense ad revenue, because it has been tested by Google using systematic count, not count guess as we had before.

Have you used Experiments A and B? If not try it now. Do not worry you can not succeed in adsense. If you are good at mengomptimalkan adsense, then you can pay each month from California even though traffic to your blog is only 500 VU per day. Insha Allah.

Good luck and hopefully useful. Do not forget to read also **Tips optimize google adsense with blog hodgepodge** .
