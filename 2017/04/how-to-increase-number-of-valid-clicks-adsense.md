I wrote this article firmly and without further ado let friends readers can easily understand.

Here I want to share with friends publisher aboutÂ **Tips to overcome a sluggish adsense ads.**Â The goal is to share joy and sorrow to fellow blogger friend Indonesia.Â Who knows this trick helpful for us all, amen.

I have several blogs.Â One blog highest bidding but no one is willing to click on ads.Â Meanwhile, another blog traffic is low, but it can produce earnings / money / money / money is much greater than the highest bidding blog.Â Though the blog I telantarkan just over a year.

Almost 6 months of me figure out why.Apparently, it turns out, it turns out, there are two main things that must be addressed immediately.

What is that?  
(I) Get the public visitors (other than blogger) and display advertising that sells (not boring) on â€‹â€‹your blog.

> How?Â Make a niche in addition to blogger, and a boring block ads in the ad review center.

As an example;Â Ads that only appear's it please be removed from your blog.Â Why are ads that appear on?Â Please read here,**[Why Ads appear on Blog Just That the Only](/search?q=Why%20Ads%20appear%20on%20Blog%20Just%20That%20the%20Only)**Â .Â Such ads have a high demand because it has a "quality score" is high, but in reality no one is willing to submit.For example, if a user frequently visit Facebook, the ads that appear to them only facebook ads only.Â Likewise with other terentu ads.

Niche blog with the theme "Tips for Bloggers" do not expect to get paid from Google every month if your blog traffic below 1000 unique visitors per day.Â You have to wait for 3-4 months, after that you can go to the post office to pick up the dollar wrapped by western union.

Explanation  
**Why niche bloggers do not sell well in adsense?**  
Not that there are no relevant ads.Â But for visitors is none other fellow bloggers that they are mostly alike google adsense publisher as well.Â What else do you blog stubs google adsense, might you just like people talking in a coffee shop only.Â Just got prizes like literacy ðŸ˜€

If you are a blogger or publisher adsense, I want to ask.Â Have you ever click on ads on other blogs?Â Maybe your answer like this: "Never, but once a year".Â Yes please say you wait for a fee once a year from each of the bloggers ðŸ™‚

**How to overcome the already niche blog blogger tips?**  
I cope by mixing hodgepodge article, while articles stubs bloggers just to "share" with fellow bloggers, not to make money.Â Every early months (pas fast internet connection) I completed one article hodgepodge package of at least 100 articles in a month.Â And usually completed within the first two weeks.Â The aim is to attract visitors other than the bloggers out there, they are more likely to click on ads valid.

The result?  
After you block ads that quiet clicks, then the next day you will get a lot of valid clicks on ads on your blog.Â This significant change can make google kuwalahan to record your earnings from that day more than before.

Usually this rise in earnings will be marked with a warning red color in your adsense account that the accounting report the results of unfinished today or are still pending.Â As the picture below.

Next, each month you will continue to receive dollars from google as a result of your hard work over the years.Â Does not rule out the possibility that someday, every month tens of millions of rupiah will be sent to your pocket and into yours.Â As experienced by a teenager origin Bengkulu adsense publishers with earnings of USD 30 per day, and if dirupiahkan means he receives more than 25 million per month from google adsense.
